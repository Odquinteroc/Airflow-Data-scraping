Omega solutions Inc
Job Description
Project Overview:
Perform full stack big data ETL/ELT development. Perform application development, enhancements, and maintenance for various applications, components, and platforms. These may include integrated data and analytics platform (data lake), data ingestion components, self-serve analytics, and data visualization tools, and tool/application integration; other websites and applications; projects related to advanced analytics (AA), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML).

This role may be required to develop/work with technologies such as LAMP/LAMP-like stacks (e.g. Linux, Apache, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Python), Java, Hadoop, Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) and other big data technologies, SAS Visual Analytics on Viya. MS Power BI, other BI/data analytics/visualization technologies, AA/AI/ML tools, and other open source or proprietary tools. There may also be technologies not yet identified or determined by the client. The projects that this role will be involved in will have a data-centric focus.

Background:

The Government of Alberta (GoA) provides a number of services to Albertans. Every ministry provides a unique set of services. In doing so, large amounts of data are generated on a daily basis. GoA is in a position to use this data for the social good of its citizens by transforming the way it organizes itself, run its processes and make decisions.

The growing expectation of citizens is just one of the challenges facing governments today. Rapid urbanization, an aging population and complex socio-economic problems are putting public services under strain. With low economic growth that resulted in lower budgets, GoA need to find solutions that are both efficient and sustainable.

Globally, the private sector uses AA/AI/ML technologies to automate tasks, make better decisions and improve customer experience. GoA recognizes the potential of these technologies to transform the way they organize themselves and run its processes. By use of such technologies, GoA can anticipate the expectations of citizens, create new services, and take appropriate action to provide services to enhance and secure their lives. Being a public body, there is a distinction in how use of such technologies would provide additional benefits to the GoA, as compared to the private sector.

GoA already has self-serve data visualization tools in place (e.g. SAS Visual Analytics, MS Power BI). Integrated data and analytics platform (data lake - Cloudera Data Platform) is in the later stages of implementation in the GoA. AI/ML tools are mainly in the conceptual or planning phase in GoA, although there may already be small pockets of implementation.
Job Description:

L’équipe canadienne de l’IA appliquée de Thales est à la recherche d’un chercheur talentueux avec un grand appétit pour résoudre des problèmes complexes de recherche et les appliquer à des projets d’apprentissage automatique pour des systèmes critiques. L’équipe travaille pour développer des solutions de pointe qui permettent d’inclure des capacités de science de données et d’aide à la décision.
Thales Group is a global organization with operations on all continents serving five major markets, all of them of vital importance for our societies: aerospace, space, defense and security, and digital identity and security. From the bottom of the ocean to the depth of space and cyberspace, Thales Group provides a unique range of technologies and services that make tomorrow possible, today.

Thales’ Applied AI Research Team in Canada is looking for a talented researcher with a great appetite to solve complex research questions and apply them to critical machine learning projects. The team aims to design and implement cutting-edge solutions by incorporating Data Science and Decision Making capabilities.
Principaux domaines de responsabilité
Un scientifique de recherche et technologie (R&T) en science de données et aide à la décision est chargé de découvrir, de réaliser et d'intégrer des concepts innovants en IA dans les solutions Thales. Il/elle prouve leur viabilité à travers la mise en œuvre de preuves de concepts et guide leur croissance en maturité à travers des prototypes et des démonstrateurs qui illustreront et permettront à leur tour leur plein potentiel commercial.
Pour réussir dans ce rôle, la curiosité pour ce qui est nouveau, la volonté de défier le statu quo, l'ouverture d'esprit et la pensée originale sont essentielles. L'individu doit rapidement apprendre et évaluer les nouvelles techniques et technologies afin de décider de les adopter, de les adapter ou de les abandonner. Il doit également être capable de proposer de nouvelles idées, de les présenter, de les questionner et de les améliorer en permanence. La personne doit posséder des compétences techniques approfondies et pratiques et être familière avec les outils et méthodes associés à la recherche opérationnelle. Le candidat doit démontrer une solide compréhension de la méthode scientifique et sa capacité à fournir un contenu de qualité à toutes les étapes du processus de recherche : de la capacité à résumer le contexte théorique d'un nouveau domaine jusqu’à la diffusion des résultats de la recherche par le biais de publications revues par les pairs, de brevets ou autres moyens.
Le scientifique fait partie d'une équipe pluridisciplinaire. Un fort esprit d'équipe et des capacités de travail d'équipe sont obligatoires. Le candidat idéal est donc en mesure de démontrer des compétences transversales qui faciliteraient le transfert du travail effectué à tous les intervenants impliqués. Il / elle contribuera en tant qu'expert technique aux projets de recherche et technologie de Thales et de ses unités commerciales. Par conséquent, de bonnes capacités de communication sont requises.
Responsibiliés du Scientifique en IA appliquée:
Effectuer des recherches et développer des algorithmes pour les systèmes critiques.
Concevoir et mettre en œuvre des modèles d'IA à grande échelle pour résoudre un grand nombre de problèmes complexes.
Publier les résultats de la recherche dans des conférences sur l'IA de premier plan et contribuer à la publication de brevets d'innovation.
Faire preuve de bonnes compétences en matière de communication avec les scientifiques, les ingénieurs et les parties prenantes.
Faire preuve de discernement dans le choix des méthodes et des techniques pour obtenir des solutions.
Collaborer avec des instituts universitaires ou de recherche (par exemple, CRSNG, MITACS, etc.), avec des partenaires industriels et avec des unités/équipes internes de Thales.
Proposer, collecter et synthétiser les exigences du système auprès des parties prenantes et créer des feuilles de route efficaces.
A Research and Technology (R&T) AI scientist in Data Science and Decision Making is responsible for discovering, enabling and integrating complex innovative AI concepts into Thales solutions. He/she proves their viability through the implementation of Proofs of Concept (PoCs) and guides their maturity growth through prototypes and demonstrators that will in turn illustrate and enable their full business potential.
To be successful in this role, curiosity for what is new, willingness to challenge the status quo, open-mindedness and out-of-the-box thinking are crucial. The individual should quickly learn and assess new techniques and technologies in order to decide whether to adopt, adapt or discard them. He/she also needs to be able to come up with new ideas, present them, challenge them and improve them continuously. The individual must possess deep, hands-on technical skills and be familiar with operations research methods and tools. The candidate must demonstrate a strong understanding of the scientific method and his/her ability to deliver quality content at all steps of the research process, from the capability to summarize the theoretical background of a novel domain to the dissemination of research outputs through peer-reviewed publications, patents or other means.
The scientist is part of a multi-disciplinary team. Strong team spirit and teamwork capabilities are mandatory. The ideal candidate therefore is able to demonstrate transverse skills that would facilitate the transfer of the work carried out to all stakeholders involved. He/she will contribute as a technical subject matter expert to Research and Technology projects across Thales and its business units. Therefore, good communication skills are required.
