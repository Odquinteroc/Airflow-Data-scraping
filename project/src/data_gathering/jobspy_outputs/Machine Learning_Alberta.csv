*If you are interested in applying machine learning to real\\-world industrial challenges, specifically in predictive maintenance using time\\-series sensor data \\- this is a perfect opportunity for you. Be a part of a team of research and machine learning scientists developing models to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance strategies, and get mentored by some of the best minds in AI while doing it.* 




 \\- Dave Staszak, Lead Machine Learning Scientist
 



**About the Role** 




 This is a paid Residency that will be undertaken over an eight\\-month period with the potential to be hired by our client afterwards (note: at the discretion of the client). The Resident will be reporting to an Amii Scientist and regularly consult with the Client team to share insights and engage in knowledge transfer activities.
 



**About our Client** 




 Supreme International is recognized as one of the best feed mixer manufacturers in the world. Supreme entered the global market very early on as a manufacturer working with markets in Saudi Arabia, Japan and Australia and now has a broader presence in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas. Supreme continues to be the benchmark for quality equipment globally. Often paired with the words performance and reliability, Supreme feed mixers have found a place on the world stage. Supreme's main facility is located in Wetaskiwin, Alberta. In 2010, Supreme expanded into the US with a truck mount assembly facility and a parts distribution warehouse located in Dodge City, Kansas. This centralized location improved parts distribution throughout North America and is a more efficient location for truck mount assembly.
 



**About the Project** 




 The project will leverage Supreme Internationals current control and monitoring system to develop a predictive maintenance system for Supreme Internationals GEN3\\-controlled animal feed mixers by leveraging machine learning models.
